  title: WASAPhoto - OpenAPI 3.0
  description: |-
    Keep in touch with your friends by sharing photos of special moments, thanks to WASAPhoto! \
    Directly from your PC, you can upload your photos, and they will be visible to everyone who is following you.
    
    Functional design specification:
    
    - The login is performed by specifying the username and it returns a crafted userID(token).
    - Once in, the user sees on the web app the stream of photos of the users that he follows ordered in reverse chronological order.
    - Each photo has information about the date-time it was uploaded, the number of likes and the number of comments.
    - Users can place a like to photos from other users(not from themselves);
    - Users can remove likes from photos of other users;
    - Users can add comments to any photo and can edit comments to any photo(even for themselves);
    - Only the author can remove comments from a photo;
    - Users have their own personal profiles.
    
    When you access to the personal profile of a user you can see:
    - user’s photos (in reverse chronological order), 
    - their followers,
    - their following, 
    - how many photos have been uploaded.
    
    User action:
    - change his/her own username,
    - follow/unfollow other users,
    - upload photos, 
    - remove photos: also remove likes and comments.
    - Users can ban other users.
    If Alice bans Bob, Bob won't be able to see any information about Alice. 
    Alice can decide to remove the ban at any moment.
    
    Finally:
    - User profiles can be searched via username.

    • doLogin
    • getMyStream
    • setMyUserName

            The simplified login tell us that, since there is no password, the username must be unique among the application. 
            Logging in with an existing name will grant access to that user information. 
            Hence it would make sense to use the username as ID since we don't have to represent real people but virtual people, namely usernames, by simplifying in this way the ReST OpenAPI. 
            However, since it's not applicable in a real life scenario, I will use a userID that's different from the username. Thus, I'm choosing 20 chars long strings because they can store several billions of information(64^20, since the alphabet is "[a-z][A-Z][0-9]-_", 26+26+10+2=64), they are nicer to read then integers since they are shorter and almost equally fast to compute.
